            Hi my name is Nikolaj Johansen and welcome to my Website. I have coded this website from scratch with the help of Code Academy, which has taught me the basics of HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript. I am still learning a lot and really enjoying the process, and this is a way for me to test it out and try new things.
    <br>
    <br>
            This is also a place where I intend to share my interests, what Iâ€™m up to, and what I have done link <a href="blog.html"> here </a> (This is the Blog).
    <br>
    <br>

            Currently I am focusing on how to attract more users to my website by implementing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategies, and have just received Googles' AdWords Mobile Certification, and currently working on getting certified in Google Analytics.
    <br>
    <br>
             Enjoy
